    <div id="tribute-info">Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955,
      Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity
      and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally
      considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.

      <h1>Albert Einstein: His life, theories and impact on science</h1>
      <span id="author">By Ailsa Harvey, Elizabeth Howell</span>
      <h2> Where would science be without Albert Einstein?</h2>
      <p class="para">Albert Einstein is often cited as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. His
        work
        continues to help astronomers study everything from gravitational waves to Mercury's orbit.
      </p>

      <p class="para">The scientist's equation that helped explain special relativity – E = mc^2 – is famous even among
        those who
        don't understand its underlying physics. Einstein is also known for his theory of general relativity (an
        explanation of gravity), and the photoelectric effect (which explains the behavior of electrons under certain
        circumstances); his work on the latter earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
      </p>

      <p class="para">Einstein also tried in vain to unify all the forces of the universe in a single theory, or a
        theory of
        everything, which he was still working on at the time of his death.
      </p>

      <h3>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
      <p class="para">Einstein's career sent him to multiple countries. He earned his doctorate from the University of
        Zurich in 1905
        and subsequently took on professor positions in Zurich (1909), Prague (1911) and Zurich again (1912). Next, he
        moved to Berlin to become director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and a professor at the University of
        Berlin (1914). He also became a German citizen.
      </p>

      <p class="para">A major validation of Einstein's work came in 1919, when Sir Arthur Eddington, secretary of the
        Royal
        Astronomical Society, led an expedition to Africa that measured the position of stars during a total solar
        eclipse. The group found that the position of stars was shifted due to the bending of light around the sun. (In
        2008, a BBC/HBO production dramatized the story in "Einstein and Eddington.")
      </p>

      <p class="para">Einstein remained in Germany until 1933 when dictator Adolf Hitler rose to power. The physicist
        then renounced
        his German citizenship and moved to the United States to become a professor of theoretical physics at Princeton.
        He became a U.S. citizen in 1940 and retired in 1945.
      </p>

      <p class="para">Einstein remained active in the physics community throughout his later years. In 1939, he famously
        penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning that uranium could be used for an atomic bomb.
      </p>

      <p class="para">Late in Einstein's life, he engaged in a series of private debates with physicist Niels Bohr about
        the validity
        of quantum theory. Bohr's theories held the day, and Einstein later incorporated quantum theory into his own
        calculations.
      </p>

      <h3>EINSTEIN'S SCIENTIFIC LEGACY</h3>
      
      <p class="para">Einstein's legacy in physics is significant. Here are some of the key scientific principles that he pioneered:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Theory of special relativity</li>
        <li>Theory of general relativity</li>
        <li>Photoelectric effect</li>
        <li>Unified field theory</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>EINSTEIN'S ASTRONOMICAL LEGACY</h3>
      
      <p class="para">There are many applications of Einstein's work, but here are some of the most notable ones in
        astronomy:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Gravitational waves</li>
        <li>Mercury's orbit</li>
        <li>Gravitational lensing</li>
        <li>Black holes</li>
      </ul>
